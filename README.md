# Beacon  
Beacon is an offline survival utility specifically designed for mobile devices (phones and tablets). Built with Alpine.js and Tailwind CSS, it provides essential survival tools such as:

✅ SOS Signal (Audible distress signal)
✅ Signal Mirror (Flashes SOS in Morse Code)
✅ Compass (Device-based direction finder)
✅ Pedometer (Step counter with distance tracking)

✅ Notepad (Offline text storage for survival notes)

Whether you're hiking, camping, or preparing for emergencies, Beacon functions completely offline to ensure reliability when it matters most.
