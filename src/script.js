  📌 NOTE: This code is designed for **mobile devices and tablets** with motion sensors (accelerometer and gyroscope).  
  📲 Works best on **modern smartphones** that support the `devicemotion` and `deviceorientationabsolute` events.  
  🖥️ **Does NOT work on desktops/laptops** because they lack motion sensors.  
  ⚠️ If using iOS (Safari), users may need to **enable motion & orientation access** in Settings > Safari > Motion & Orientation Access.
